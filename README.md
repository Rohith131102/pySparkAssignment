# pySparkAssignment

Created two files 
- dataframe.py
- covidapp.py

In dataframe.py,got the data from api,converted it into rdd and then into df and eventually cleansed the dataframe
In covidapp.py,Using the df above,solved the queries asked in the assignment and then created a restful api using flask to display the results.

Added comments to every query to make it understandable
